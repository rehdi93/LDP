    <abstract>

      <para>This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of
	scripting or programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an
	intermediate/advanced level of instruction <emphasis>. . . all
	the while sneaking in little nuggets of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> wisdom and lore</emphasis>. It
	serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and
	source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The exercises
	and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation,
	under the premise that <userinput>the only way to really learn
	scripting is to write scripts</userinput>.</para>

      <para>This book is suitable for classroom use as a
        general introduction to programming concepts.</para>

      <para>How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange
	tale. It seems that a few years back I needed to learn
	shell scripting -- and what better way to do that than to read a
	good book on the subject? I was looking to buy a tutorial and
	reference covering all aspects of the subject. I was looking for a
	book that would take difficult concepts, turn them inside out, and
	explain them in excruciating detail, with well-commented examples.
	    <footnote><para>This is the notorious <emphasis>flog
	    it to death</emphasis> technique that works so well
	    with slow learners, eccentrics, odd ducks, fools and
	    geniuses.</para></footnote>
	In fact, I was looking for <emphasis>this very book</emphasis>,
	or something very much like it. Unfortunately, <link linkend="kochanref">it didn't exist</link>, and if I wanted it,
	I'd have to write it. And so, here we are, folks.</para>

      <para>That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad
        professor. Crazy as a loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a
        book, any book -- at the library, at a bookstore, anywhere --
        he would become totally obsessed with the idea that he could have
        written it, should have written it -- and done a better job of it
        to boot. He would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that,
        write a book with the very same title. When he died some years
        later, he allegedly had several thousand books to his credit,
        probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have
        been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's
        a fellow who lived his dream, even if he was obsessed by it,
        driven by it . . . and somehow I can't help admiring the old
        coot.</para>

# Version 0.2.1: Added 2-second delay between generations.

# ##################################################################### #
# This is the Bash script version of John Conway's "Game of Life".      #
# "Life" is a simple implementation of cellular automata.               #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# On a rectangular grid, let each "cell" be either "living" or "dead."  #
# Designate a living cell with a dot, and a dead one with a blank space.#
#      Begin with an arbitrarily drawn dot-and-blank grid,              #
#+     and let this be the starting generation: generation 0.           #
# Determine each successive generation by the following rules:          #
#   1) Each cell has 8 neighbors, the adjoining cells                   #
#+     left, right, top, bottom, and the 4 diagonals.                   #
#                                                                       #
#                       123                                             #
#                       4*5     The * is the cell under consideration.  #
#                       678                                             #

# 2) A living cell with either 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive.   #
SURVIVE=2                                                               #
# 3) A dead cell with 3 living neighbors comes alive, a "birth."        #

# 4) All other cases result in a dead cell for the next generation.     #

# The grid in this script has a "boundary problem."

# Exercise: Change the script to have the grid wrap around,
# +         so that the left and right sides will "touch,"      
# +         as will the top and bottom.
#
# Exercise: Create a new "gen0" file to seed this script.
#           Use a 12 x 16 grid, instead of the original 10 x 10 one.
#           Make the necessary changes to the script,
#+          so it will run with the altered file.
#
# Exercise: Modify this script so that it can determine the grid size
#+          from the "gen0" file, and set any variables necessary
#+          for the script to run.
#           This would make unnecessary any changes to variables
#+          in the script for an altered grid size.
#
# Exercise: Optimize this script.

## Recursive file/dirsize checking script, by Patsie
##
## This script builds a list of files/directories and their size (du -akx)
## and processes this list to a human readable tree shape
## The 'du -akx' is only as good as the permissions the owner has.
## So preferably run as root* to get the best results, or use only on
## directories for which you have read permissions. Anything you can't
## read is not in the list.

#* ABS Guide author advises caution when running scripts as root!

# Line strcat, but strncat appends a maximum of n characters from the value
# of variable s2.  It copies fewer if the value of variabl s2 is shorter
# than n characters.  Echoes result on stdout.

# Usage: strtok s1 s2
#
# Strtok considers the string s1 to consist of a sequence of zero or more
# text tokens separated by spans of one or more characters from the
# separator string s2.  The first call (with a non-empty string s1
# specified) echoes a string consisting of the first token on stdout. The
# function keeps track of its position in the string s1 between separate
# calls, so that subsequent calls made with the first argument an empty
# string will work through the string immediately following that token.  In
# this way subsequent calls will work through the string s1 until no tokens
# remain.  The separator string s2 may be different from call to call.
# When no token remains in s1, an empty value is echoed on stdout.

Walk an array of directory fields produced by ListDirectory

Having suppressed the line breaks in an otherwise line oriented
report, build an index to the array element which starts each line.

Each line gets two index entries, the first element of each line
(inode) and the element that holds the pathname of the file.

The first index entry pair (Line-Number==0) are informational:
Index-Array-Name[0] : Number of "Lines" indexed
Index-Array-Name[1] : "Current Line" pointer into Index-Array-Name

The following index pairs (if any) hold element indexes into
the Field-Array-Name per:
Index-Array-Name[Line-Number * 2] : The "inode" field element.
NOTE: This distance may be either +11 or +12 elements.
Index-Array-Name[(Line-Number * 2) + 1] : The "pathname" element.
NOTE: This distance may be a variable number of elements.
Next line index pair for Line-Number+1.

The key (no pun intended) to a Unified Content File System (UCFS)
is to distinguish the files in the system based on their content.
Distinguishing files by their name is just so 20th Century.

The content is distinguished by computing a checksum of that content.
This version uses the md5sum program to generate a 128 bit checksum
representative of the file's contents.
There is a chance that two files having different content might
generate the same checksum using md5sum (or any checksum).  Should
that become a problem, then the use of md5sum can be replace by a
cyrptographic signature.  But until then...

The md5sum program is documented as outputting three fields (and it
does), but when read it appears as two fields (array elements).  This
is caused by the lack of whitespace between the second and third field.
So this function gropes the md5sum output and returns:
	[0]	32 character checksum in hexidecimal (UCFS filename)
	[1]	Single character: ' ' text file, '*' binary file
	[2]	Filesystem (20th Century Style) name
	Note: That name may be the character '-' indicating STDIN read.

# Functions making emulating hashes in Bash a little less painful.


#    Limitations:
#  * Only global variables are supported.
#  * Each hash instance generates one global variable per value.
#  * Variable names collisions are possible
#+   if you define variable like __hash__hashname_key
#  * Keys must use chars that can be part of a Bash variable name
#+   (no dashes, periods, etc.).
#  * The hash is created as a variable:
#    ... hashname_keyname
#    So if somone will create hashes like:
#      myhash_ + mykey = myhash__mykey
#      myhash + _mykey = myhash__mykey
#    Then there will be a collision.
#    (This should not pose a major problem.)

#  Now that the string contents are set, Bash will always, internally,

#  Why?
#  Considering our "$(_pls 'Hello ${Me}')" construction:
#  " ... " -&gt; Expansion required, strip the quotes.
#  $( ... ) -&gt; Replace with the result of..., strip this.
#  _pls ' ... ' -&gt; called with literal arguments, strip the quotes.
#  The result returned includes hard quotes; BUT the above processing
#+ has already been done, so they become part of the value assigned.
#
#  Similarly, during further usage of the string variable, the ${Me}
#+ is part of the contents (result) and survives any operations
#  (Until explicitly told to evaluate the string).

#  Hint: See what happens when the hard quotes ($'\x27') are replaced
#+ with soft quotes ($'\x22') in the above procedures.
#  Interesting also is to remove the addition of any quoting.

    Application code: goto "# # # Hunt the Spammer' program code # # #"
    Example output: ":&lt;&lt;-'_is_spammer_outputs_'"
    How to use: Enter script name without arguments.
                Or goto "Quickstart" at end of script.

Provides
    Given a domain name or IP(v4) address as input:

    Does an exhaustive set of queries to find the associated
    network resources (short of recursing into TLDs).

    Checks the IP(v4) addresses found against Blacklist
    nameservers.

    If found to be a blacklisted IP(v4) address,
    reports the blacklist text records.
    (Usually hyper-links to the specific report.)

Requires
    A working Internet connection.
    (Exercise: Add check and/or abort if not on-line when running script.)
    Bash with arrays (2.05b+).

    The external program 'dig' --
    a utility program provided with the 'bind' set of programs.
    Specifically, the version which is part of Bind series 9.x
    See: http://www.isc.org

    All usages of 'dig' are limited to wrapper functions,
    which may be rewritten as required.
    See: dig_wrappers.bash for details.
         ("Additional documentation" -- below)

Usage
    Script requires a single argument, which may be:
    1) A domain name;
    2) An IP(v4) address;
    3) A filename, with one name or address per line.

    Script accepts an optional second argument, which may be:
    1) A Blacklist server name;
    2) A filename, with one Blacklist server name per line.

    If the second argument is not provided, the script uses
    a built-in set of (free) Blacklist servers.

    See also, the Quickstart at the end of this script (after 'exit').

Return Codes
    0 - All OK
    1 - Script failure
    2 - Something is Blacklisted

Optional environment variables
    SPAMMER_TRACE
        If set to a writable file,
        script will log an execution flow trace.

    SPAMMER_DATA
        If set to a writable file, script will dump its
        discovered data in the form of GraphViz file.
        See: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz

    SPAMMER_LIMIT
        Limits the depth of resource tracing.

        Default is 2 levels.

        A setting of 0 (zero) means 'unlimited' . . .
          Caution: script might recurse the whole Internet!

        A limit of 1 or 2 is most useful when processing
        a file of domain names and addresses.
        A higher limit can be useful when hunting spam gangs.

    This script uses a large number of functions.
    Nearly all general functions have their own example script.
    Each of the example scripts have tutorial level comments.

Scripting project
    Add support for IP(v6) addresses.
    IP(v6) addresses are recognized but not processed.

Advanced project
    Add the reverse lookup detail to the discovered information.

    Report the delegation chain and abuse contacts.

    Modify the GraphViz file output to include the
    newly discovered information.

    cat &lt;&lt;-'_usage_statement_'
    The script is_spammer.bash requires either one or two arguments.

    arg 1) May be one of:
        a) A domain name
        b) An IPv4 address
        c) The name of a file with any mix of names
           and addresses, one per line.

    arg 2) May be one of:
        a) A Blacklist server domain name
        b) The name of a file with Blacklist server
           domain names, one per line.
        c) If not present, a default list of (free)
           Blacklist servers is used.
        d) If a filename of an empty, readable, file
           is given,
           Blacklist server lookup is disabled.

    All script output is written to stdout.

    Return codes: 0 -&gt; All OK, 1 -&gt; Script failure,
                  2 -&gt; Something is Blacklisted.

    Requires the external program 'dig' from the 'bind-9'
    set of DNS programs.  See: http://www.isc.org

    The domain name lookup depth limit defaults to 2 levels.
    Set the environment variable SPAMMER_LIMIT to change.
    SPAMMER_LIMIT=0 means 'unlimited'

    Limit may also be set on the command-line.
    If arg#1 is an integer, the limit is set to that value
    and then the above argument rules are applied.

    Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER_DATA' to a filename
    will cause the script to write a GraphViz graphic file.

    For the development version;
    Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER_TRACE' to a filename
    will cause the execution engine to log a function call trace.

Quickstart
==========

 Prerequisites

  Bash version 2.05b or 3.00 (bash --version)
  A version of Bash which supports arrays. Array 
  support is included by default Bash configurations.

  'dig,' version 9.x.x (dig $HOSTNAME, see first line of output)
  A version of dig which supports the +short options. 
  See: dig_wrappers.bash for details.


 Optional Prerequisites

  'named,' a local DNS caching program. Any flavor will do.
  Do twice: dig $HOSTNAME 
  Check near bottom of output for: SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53
  That means you have one running.


 Optional Graphics Support

  'date,' a standard *nix thing. (date -R)

  dot Program to convert graphic description file to a 
  diagram. (dot -V)
  A part of the Graph-Viz set of programs.
  See: [http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz||GraphViz]

  'dotty,' a visual editor for graphic description files.
  Also a part of the Graph-Viz set of programs.




 Quick Start

In the same directory as the is_spammer.bash script; 
Do: ./is_spammer.bash

 Usage Details

1. Blacklist server choices.

  (a) To use default, built-in list: Do nothing.

  (b) To use your own list: 

    i. Create a file with a single Blacklist server 
       domain name per line.

    ii. Provide that filename as the last argument to 
        the script.

  (c) To use a single Blacklist server: Last argument 
      to the script.

  (d) To disable Blacklist lookups:

    i. Create an empty file (touch spammer.nul)
       Your choice of filename.

    ii. Provide the filename of that empty file as the 
        last argument to the script.

2. Search depth limit.

  (a) To use the default value of 2: Do nothing.

  (b) To set a different limit: 
      A limit of 0 means: no limit.

    i. export SPAMMER_LIMIT=1
       or whatever limit you want.

    ii. OR provide the desired limit as the first 
       argument to the script.

3. Optional execution trace log.

  (a) To use the default setting of no log output: Do nothing.

  (b) To write an execution trace log:
      export SPAMMER_TRACE=spammer.log
      or whatever filename you want.

4. Optional graphic description file.

  (a) To use the default setting of no graphic file: Do nothing.

  (b) To write a Graph-Viz graphic description file:
      export SPAMMER_DATA=spammer.dot
      or whatever filename you want.

5. Where to start the search.

  (a) Starting with a single domain name:

    i. Without a command-line search limit: First 
       argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Second 
        argument to script.

  (b) Starting with a single IP address:

    i. Without a command-line search limit: First 
       argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Second 
        argument to script.

  (c) Starting with (mixed) multiple name(s) and/or address(es):
      Create a file with one name or address per line.
      Your choice of filename.

    i. Without a command-line search limit: Filename as 
       first argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Filename as 
        second argument to script.

6. What to do with the display output.

  (a) To view display output on screen: Do nothing.

  (b) To save display output to a file: Redirect stdout to a filename.

  (c) To discard display output: Redirect stdout to /dev/null.

7. Temporary end of decision making. 
   press RETURN 
   wait (optionally, watch the dots and colons).

8. Optionally check the return code.

  (a) Return code 0: All OK

  (b) Return code 1: Script setup failure

  (c) Return code 2: Something was blacklisted.

9. Where is my graph (diagram)?

The script does not directly produce a graph (diagram). 
It only produces a graphic description file. You can 
process the graphic descriptor file that was output 
with the 'dot' program.

Until you edit that descriptor file, to describe the 
relationships you want shown, all that you will get is 
a bunch of labeled name and address nodes.

All of the script's discovered relationships are within 
a comment block in the graphic descriptor file, each 
with a descriptive heading.

The editing required to draw a line between a pair of 
nodes from the information in the descriptor file may 
be done with a text editor. 

Given these lines somewhere in the descriptor file:

# Known domain name nodes

N0000 [label="guardproof.info."] ;

N0002 [label="third.guardproof.info."] ;



# Known address nodes

A0000 [label="61.141.32.197"] ;



/*

# Known name-&gt;address edges

NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197



# Known parent-&gt;child edges

PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

 */

Turn that into the following lines by substituting node 
identifiers into the relationships:

# Known domain name nodes

N0000 [label="guardproof.info."] ;

N0002 [label="third.guardproof.info."] ;



# Known address nodes

A0000 [label="61.141.32.197"] ;



# PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

N0000-&gt;N0002 ;



# NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197

N0002-&gt;A0000 ;



/*

# Known name-&gt;address edges

NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197



# Known parent-&gt;child edges

PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

 */

Process that with the 'dot' program, and you have your 
first network diagram.

In addition to the conventional graphic edges, the 
descriptor file includes similar format pair-data that 
describes services, zone records (sub-graphs?), 
blacklisted addresses, and other things which might be 
interesting to include in your graph. This additional 
information could be displayed as different node 
shapes, colors, line sizes, etc.

The descriptor file can also be read and edited by a 
Bash script (of course). You should be able to find 
most of the functions required within the 
"is_spammer.bash" script.

# changelog:

# 07/02/2005.  Fixups by Little Monster.
# 02/02/2005.  Minor additions by Little Monster.
#              (See after # +++++++++++ )
# 29/01/2005.  Minor stylistic edits and cleanups by author of ABS Guide.
#              Added exit error codes.
# 22/11/2004.  Finished initial version of second version of wgetter:
#              wgetter2 is born.
# 01/12/2004.  Changed 'runn' function so it can be run 2 ways --
#              either ask for a file name or have one input on the CL.
# 01/12/2004.  Made sensible handling of no URL's given.
# 01/12/2004.  Made loop of main options, so you don't
#              have to keep calling wgetter 2 all the time.
#              Runs as a session instead.
# 01/12/2004.  Added looping to 'runn' function.
#              Simplified and improved.
# 01/12/2004.  Added state to recursion setting.
#              Enables re-use of previous value.
# 05/12/2004.  Modified the file detection routine in the 'runn' function
#              so it's not fooled by empty values, and is cleaner.
# 01/02/2004.  Added cookie finding routine from later version (which 
#              isn't ready yet), so as not to have hard-coded paths.
# =======================================================================

# ==&gt; What is "podcasting"?

# ==&gt; It's broadcasting "radio shows" over the Internet.
# ==&gt; These shows can be played on iPods and other music file players.

# ==&gt; This script makes it possible.
# ==&gt; See documentation at the script author's site, above.

# ==&gt; ################################################################


# Make script crontab friendly:
cd $(dirname $0)
# ==&gt; Change to directory where this script lives.

# datadir is the directory you want podcasts saved to:
datadir=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
# ==&gt; Will create a date-labeled directory, named: YYYY-MM-DD

# Check for and create datadir if necessary:
if test ! -d $datadir
        then
        mkdir $datadir
fi

# Delete any temp file:
rm -f temp.log

#  Read the bp.conf file and wget any url not already
#+ in the podcast.log file:
while read podcast
  do # ==&gt; Main action follows.
  file=$(wget -q $podcast -O - | tr '\r' '\n' | tr \' \" | \
sed -n 's/.*url="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  for url in $file

#  This does a backup from the host computer to a locally connected
#+ firewire HDD using rsync and ssh.
#  (Script should work with USB-connected device (see lines 40-43).
#  It then rotates the backups.
#  Run it via cron every night at 5am.
#  This only backs up the home directory.
#  If ownerships (other than the user's) should be preserved,
#+ then run the rsync process as root (and re-instate the -o).
#  We save every day for 7 days, then every week for 4 weeks,
#+ then every month for 3 months.

#  See: http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/
#+ for more explanation of the theory.
#  Save as: $HOME/bin/nightly-backup_firewire-hdd.sh

#  Known bugs:
#  ----------
#  i)  Ideally, we want to exclude ~/.tmp and the browser caches.

#  ii) If the user is sitting at the computer at 5am,
#+     and files are modified while the rsync is occurring,
#+     then the BACKUP_JUSTINCASE branch gets triggered.
#      To some extent, this is a 
#+     feature, but it also causes a "disk-space leak".

    -f [&lt;file&gt;] File entries to &lt;file&gt;.

                If no filename supplied then default file
                (${CDPath}${2:-"$CDFile"}) is used
                -F and -U are silent versions
    -v          Print version number
    -h          Help
    -H          Detailed help

    *The special entries (0 - 9) are held until log off, replaced by another
     entry or updated with the -u command

    Alternative suggested directories:
    If a directory is not found then CD will suggest any
    possibilities. These are directories starting with the same letters
    and if any are found they are listed prefixed with -a&lt;n&gt;
    where &lt;n&gt; is a number.
    It's possible to go to the directory by entering cd -a&lt;n&gt;
    on the command line.
    
    The directory for -r&lt;n&gt; or -R&lt;n&gt; may be a number.
    For example:
        $ cd -r3 4  Go to history entry 4 and put it on special entry 3
        $ cd -R3 4  Put current dir on the special entry 3
                    and go to history entry 4
        $ cd -s3    Go to special entry 3
    
    Note that commands R,r,S and s may be used without a number
    and refer to 0:
        $ cd -s     Go to special entry 0
        $ cd -S     Go to special entry 0 and make special
                    entry 0 current dir
        $ cd -r 1   Go to history entry 1 and put it on special entry 0
        $ cd -r     Go to history entry 0 and put it on special entry 0

        Set the following environment variables:
            CDL_PROMPTLEN  - Set to the length of prompt you require.
                Prompt string is set to the right characters of the
                current directory.
                If not set then prompt is left unchanged
            CDL_PROMPT_PRE - Set to the string to prefix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  \"\\[\\e[01;34m\\]\"  (sets colour to blue).
                    root:      \"\\[\\e[01;31m\\]\"  (sets colour to red).
            CDL_PROMPT_POST    - Set to the string to suffix the prompt.
                Default is:

                                (resets colour and displays $).

                                (resets colour and displays #).
            CDPath - Set the default path for the -f &amp; -u options.
                     Default is home directory

=======================================================================

cdll is a replacement for cd and incorporates similar functionality to
the bash pushd and popd commands but is independent of them.

This version of cdll has been tested on Linux using Bash. It will work
on most Linux versions but will probably not work on other shells without
modification.

Introduction
============

cdll allows easy moving about between directories. When changing to a new
directory the current one is automatically put onto a stack. By default
50 entries are kept, but this is configurable. Special directories can be
kept for easy access - by default up to 10, but this is configurable. The
most recent stack entries and the special entries can be easily viewed.

The directory stack and special entries can be saved to, and loaded from,
a file. This allows them to be set up on login, saved before logging out
or changed when moving project to project.

In addition, cdll provides a flexible command prompt facility that allows,
for example, a directory name in colour that is truncated from the left
if it gets too long.


Setting up cdll
===============

Copy cdll to either your local home directory or a central directory
such as /usr/bin (this will require root access).

Copy the file cdfile to your home directory. It will require read and
write access. This a default file that contains a directory stack and
special entries.

To replace the cd command you must add commands to your login script.
The login script is one or more of:

    /etc/profile
    ~/.bash_profile
    ~/.bash_login
    ~/.profile
    ~/.bashrc
    /etc/bash.bashrc.local
    
To setup your login, ~/.bashrc is recommended, for global (and root) setup
add the commands to /etc/bash.bashrc.local
    
To set up on login, add the command:
    . &lt;dir&gt;/cdll
For example if cdll is in your local home directory:
    . ~/cdll
If in /usr/bin then:
    . /usr/bin/cdll

If you want to use this instead of the buitin cd command then add:
    alias cd='cd_new'
We would also recommend the following commands:
    alias @='cd_new @'
    cd -U
    cd -D

If you want to use cdll's prompt facilty then add the following:
    CDL_PROMPTLEN=nn
Where nn is a number described below. Initially 99 would be suitable
number.

Thus the script looks something like this:

    ######################################################################
    # CD Setup
    ######################################################################
    CDL_PROMPTLEN=21        # Allow a prompt length of up to 21 characters
    . /usr/bin/cdll         # Initialise cdll
    alias cd='cd_new'       # Replace the built in cd command

The full meaning of these commands will become clear later.

There are a couple of caveats. If another program changes the directory
without calling cdll, then the directory won't be put on the stack and
also if the prompt facility is used then this will not be updated. Two
programs that can do this are pushd and popd. To update the prompt and
stack simply enter:

    cd .
    
Note that if the previous entry on the stack is the current directory
then the stack is not updated.

Usage
=====  
cd [dir] [0-9] [@[s|h] [-g &lt;dir&gt;] [-d] [-D] [-r&lt;n&gt;]
   [dir|0-9] [-R&lt;n&gt;] [&lt;dir&gt;|0-9] [-s&lt;n&gt;] [-S&lt;n&gt;]
   [-u] [-U] [-f] [-F] [-h] [-H] [-v]

    &lt;dir&gt;       Go to directory
    0-n         Goto previous directory (0 is previous,
                1 is last but 1, etc.)
                n is up to max history (default is 50)
    @           List history and special entries (Usually available as $ @)
    @h          List history entries
    @s          List special entries
    -g [&lt;dir&gt;]  Go to literal name (bypass special names)
                This is to allow access to dirs called '0','1','-h' etc
    -d          Change default action - verbose. (See note)
    -D          Change default action - silent. (See note)
    -s&lt;n&gt;       Go to the special entry &lt;n&gt;
    -S&lt;n&gt;       Go to the special entry &lt;n&gt;
                      and replace it with the current dir
    -r&lt;n&gt; [&lt;dir&gt;] Go to directory &lt;dir&gt;
                              and then put it on special entry &lt;n&gt;
    -R&lt;n&gt; [&lt;dir&gt;] Go to directory &lt;dir&gt;
                              and put current dir on special entry &lt;n&gt;
    -a&lt;n&gt;       Alternative suggested directory. See note below.
    -f [&lt;file&gt;] File entries to &lt;file&gt;.
    -u [&lt;file&gt;] Update entries from &lt;file&gt;.
                If no filename supplied then default file (~/cdfile) is used
                -F and -U are silent versions
    -v          Print version number
    -h          Help
    -H          Detailed help



Examples
========

These examples assume non-default mode is set (that is, cd with no
parameters will go to the most recent stack directory), that aliases
have been set up for cd and @ as described above and that cd's prompt
facility is active and the prompt length is 21 characters.

    /home/phil$ @
    # List the entries with the @
    History:
    # Output of the @ command
    .....
    # Skipped these entries for brevity
    1 /home/phil/ummdev               S1 /home/phil/perl
    # Most recent two history entries
    0 /home/phil/perl/eg              S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev
    # and two special entries are shown
    
    /home/phil$ cd /home/phil/utils/Cdll
    # Now change directories
    /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ @
    # Prompt reflects the directory.
    History:
    # New history
    .....   
    1 /home/phil/perl/eg              S1 /home/phil/perl
    # History entry 0 has moved to 1
    0 /home/phil                      S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev
    # and the most recent has entered
       
To go to a history entry:

    /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ cd 1
    # Go to history entry 1.
    /home/phil/perl/eg$
    # Current directory is now what was 1
    
To go to a special entry:

    /home/phil/perl/eg$ cd -s1
    # Go to special entry 1
    /home/phil/umm/ummdev$
    # Current directory is S1

To go to a directory called, for example, 1:

    /home/phil$ cd -g 1
    # -g ignores the special meaning of 1
    /home/phil/1$
    
To put current directory on the special list as S1:
    cd -r1 .        #  OR
    cd -R1 .        #  These have the same effect if the directory is
                    #+ . (the current directory)

To go to a directory and add it as a special  
  The directory for -r&lt;n&gt; or -R&lt;n&gt; may be a number.
  For example:
        $ cd -r3 4  Go to history entry 4 and put it on special entry 3
        $ cd -R3 4  Put current dir on the special entry 3 and go to
                    history entry 4
        $ cd -s3    Go to special entry 3

    Note that commands R,r,S and s may be used without a number and
    refer to 0:
        $ cd -s     Go to special entry 0
        $ cd -S     Go to special entry 0 and make special entry 0
                    current dir
        $ cd -r 1   Go to history entry 1 and put it on special entry 0
        $ cd -r     Go to history entry 0 and put it on special entry 0


    Alternative suggested directories:

    If a directory is not found, then CD will suggest any
    possibilities. These are directories starting with the same letters
    and if any are found they are listed prefixed with -a&lt;n&gt;
    where &lt;n&gt; is a number. It's possible to go to the directory
    by entering cd -a&lt;n&gt; on the command line.

        Use cd -d or -D to change default cd action. cd -H will show
        current action.

        The history entries (0-n) are stored in the environment variables
        CD[0] - CD[n]
        Similarly the special directories S0 - 9 are in the environment
        variable CDS[0] - CDS[9]
        and may be accessed from the command line, for example:
        
            ls -l ${CDS[3]}
            cat ${CD[8]}/file.txt

        The default pathname for the -f and -u commands is ~
        The default filename for the -f and -u commands is cdfile


Configuration
=============

    The following environment variables can be set:
    
        CDL_PROMPTLEN  - Set to the length of prompt you require.
            Prompt string is set to the right characters of the current
            directory. If not set, then prompt is left unchanged. Note
            that this is the number of characters that the directory is
            shortened to, not the total characters in the prompt.

            CDL_PROMPT_PRE - Set to the string to prefix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  "\\[\\e[01;34m\\]"  (sets colour to blue).
                    root:      "\\[\\e[01;31m\\]"  (sets colour to red).

            CDL_PROMPT_POST    - Set to the string to suffix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  "\\[\\e[00m\\]$"
                               (resets colour and displays $).
                    root:      "\\[\\e[00m\\]#"
                               (resets colour and displays #).

        Note:
            CDL_PROMPT_PRE &amp; _POST only t

        CDPath - Set the default path for the -f &amp; -u options.
                 Default is home directory
        CDFile - Set the default filename for the -f &amp; -u options.
                 Default is cdfile


    There are three variables defined in the file cdll which control the
    number of entries stored or displayed. They are in the section labeled
    'Initialisation here' towards the end of the file.

        cd_maxhistory       - The number of history entries stored.
                              Default is 50.
        cd_maxspecial       - The number of special entries allowed.
                              Default is 9.
        cd_histcount        - The number of history and special entries
                              displayed. Default is 9.

    Note that cd_maxspecial should be &gt;= cd_histcount to avoid displaying
    special entries that can't be set.

#  The Standard Deviation indicates how consistent a set of data is.
#  It shows to what extent the individual data points deviate from the

#  It is essentially the average deviation-distance of the

# =========================================================== #

#

# 2  Subtract each data point from the arithmetic mean,
#    and square that difference.
# 3  Add all of the individual difference-squares in # 2.
# 4  Divide the sum in # 3 by the number of data points.
#    This is known as the "variance."

#  This may be a long, cobbled-together line, which groff
#  will automatically wrap and hyphenate.
#  However, if you want multiple (newline-separated) paragraphs,
#+ these must be inserted by manual text editing on the
#+ script-generated man page.
#  Exercise (difficult): Fix this!

#  This script is not nearly as elaborate as the
#+ full-featured "manedit" package
#+ http://freshmeat.net/projects/manedit/
#+ but it's much easier to use.

The name of the game is Petals Around the Rose,
and that name is significant.
Five dice will roll and you must guess the "answer" for each roll.
It will be zero or an even number.
After your guess, you will be told the answer for the roll, but . . .
that's ALL the information you will get.

Six consecutive correct guesses admits you to the
Fellowship of the Rose.

QUACKEY is a variant of Perquackey [TM].
The rules are the same, but the scoring is simplified
and plurals of previously played words are allowed.
"Vulnerable" play is not yet implemented,
but it is otherwise feature-complete.

As the game begins, the player gets 10 letters.
The object is to construct valid dictionary words
of at least 3-letter length from the letterset.
Each word-length category
-- 3-letter, 4-letter, 5-letter, ... --
fills up with the fifth word entered,
and no further words in that category are accepted.

The penalty for too-short (two-letter), duplicate, unconstructable,
and invalid (not in dictionary) words is -200. The same penalty applies
to attempts to enter a word in a filled-up category.

INSTRUCTION1

  echo -n "Hit ENTER for next page of instructions. "; read az1

     cat &lt;&lt;INSTRUCTION2

The scoring mostly corresponds to classic Perquackey:
The first 3-letter word scores    60, plus   10 for each additional one.
The first 4-letter word scores   120, plus   20 for each additional one.
The first 5-letter word scores   200, plus   50 for each additional one.
The first 6-letter word scores   300, plus  100 for each additional one.
The first 7-letter word scores   500, plus  150 for each additional one.
The first 8-letter word scores   750, plus  250 for each additional one.
The first 9-letter word scores  1000, plus  500 for each additional one.
The first 10-letter word scores 2000, plus 2000 for each additional one.

Category completion bonuses are:
3-letter words   100
4-letter words   200
5-letter words   400
6-letter words   800
7-letter words  2000
8-letter words 10000
This is a simplification of the absurdly baroque Perquackey bonus
scoring system.

INSTRUCTION2

  echo -n "Hit ENTER for final page of instructions. "; read az1

     cat &lt;&lt;INSTRUCTION3


Hitting just ENTER for a word entry ends the game.

Individual word entry is timed to a maximum of 10 seconds.
*** Timing out on an entry ends the game. ***
Aside from that, the game is untimed.

--------------------------------------------------
Game statistics are automatically saved to a file.
--------------------------------------------------

For competitive ("duplicate") play, a previous letterset
may be duplicated by repeating the script's random seed,
command-line parameter \$1.
For example, "qky 7633" specifies the letterset 
c a d i f r h u s k ...

Nim is a game with roots in the distant past.
This particular variant starts with five rows of pegs.

1:    | | | | | 
2:     | | | | 
3:      | | | 
4:       | | 
5:        | 

The number at the left identifies the row.

The human player moves first, and alternates turns with the bot.
A turn consists of removing at least one peg from a single row.
It is permissable to remove ALL the pegs from a row.
For example, in row 2, above, the player can remove 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs.
The player who removes the last peg loses.

The strategy consists of trying to be the one who removes
the next-to-last peg(s), leaving the loser with the final peg.

To exit the game early, hit ENTER during your turn.

# Exercise:
# --------
# Improve the bot's strategy.
# There is, in fact, a Nim strategy that can force a win.
# See the Wikipedia article on Nim:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim
# Recode the bot to use this strategy (rather difficult).

#  Curiosities:
#  -----------
#  Nim played a prominent role in Alain Resnais' 1961 New Wave film,
#+ Last Year at Marienbad.
#
#  In 1978, Leo Christopherson wrote an animated version of Nim,

#    (Minor reformatting by ABS Guide author.)
#    Used in ABS Guide with script author's permission.
# Notes:
#    This script starts a few processes per lap, in addition to
#    the shell loop processing, so the assumption is made that
#    this takes an insignificant amount of time compared to
#    the response time of humans (~.1s) (or the keyboard
#    interrupt rate (~.05s)).
#    '?' for splits must be entered twice if characters
#    (erroneously) entered before it (on the same line).
#    '?' since not generating a signal may be slightly delayed
#    on heavily loaded systems.
#    Lap timings on ubuntu may be slightly delayed due to:
#    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/62511
# Changes:
#    V1.0, 23 Aug 2005, Initial release
#    V1.1, 26 Jul 2007, Allow both splits and laps from single invocation.
#                       Only start timer after a key is pressed.
#                       Indicate lap number
#                       Cache programs at startup so there is less error
#                       due to startup delays.
#    V1.2, 01 Aug 2007, Work around `date` commands that don't have
#                       nanoseconds.
#                       Use stty to change interrupt keys to space for
#                       laps etc.
#                       Ignore other input as it causes problems.
#    V1.3, 01 Aug 2007, Testing release.
#    V1.4, 02 Aug 2007, Various tweaks to get working under ubuntu
#                       and Mac OS X.
#    V1.5, 27 Jun 2008, set LANG=C as got vague bug report about it.

#             The Knight's Tour, a classic problem.               #
#             =====================================               #
#  The knight must move onto every square of the chess board,     #
#  but cannot revisit any square he has already visited.          #
#                                                                 #
#  And just why is Sir Knight unwelcome for a return visit?       #
#  Could it be that he has a habit of partying into the wee hours #
#+ of the morning?                                                #
#  Possibly he leaves pizza crusts in the bed, empty beer bottles #
#+ all over the floor, and clogs the plumbing. . . .              #
#                                                                 #
#  -------------------------------------------------------------  #
#                                                                 #
#  Usage: ktour.sh [start-square] [stupid]                        #
#                                                                 #
#  Note that start-square can be a square number                  #
#+ in the range 0 - 63 ... or                                     #
#  a square designator in conventional chess notation,            #
#  such as a1, f5, h3, etc.                                       #
#                                                                 #
#  If start-square-number not supplied,                           #
#+ then starts on a random square somewhere on the board.         #
#                                                                 #
# "stupid" as second parameter sets the stupid strategy.          #
#                                                                 #
#  Examples:                                                      #
#  ktour.sh 23          starts on square #23 (h3)                 #
#  ktour.sh g6 stupid   starts on square #46,                     #
#                       using "stupid" (non-Warnsdorff) strategy. #

# Exercises:
# ---------
#
# 1) Extend this example to a 10 x 10 board or larger.
# 2) Improve the "stupid strategy" by modifying the
#    do_move_stupid function.
#    Hint: Prevent straying into corner squares in early moves
#          (the exact opposite of Warnsdorff's algorithm!).
# 3) This script could stand considerable improvement and
#    streamlining, especially in the poorly-written
#    generate_moves() function
#    and in the DECIDE-MOVE patch in the do_move() function.
#    Must figure out why standard algorithm fails for startpos=37 ...
#+   but _not_ on any other, including symmetrical startpos=26.
#    Possibly, when calculating possible moves, counts the move back
#+   to the originating square. If so, it might be a relatively easy fix.

# Definition: A "magic square" is a two-dimensional array
#             of integers in which all the rows, columns,
#             and *long* diagonals add up to the same number.
#             Being "square," the array has the same number
#             of rows and columns. That number is the "order."
# An example of a magic square of order 3 is:
#   8  1  6   
#   3  5  7   
#   4  9  2   
# All the rows, columns, and the two long diagonals add up to 15.

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Add a function to calculate the sum of each row, column,
#    and *long* diagonal. The sums must match.
#    This is the "magic constant" of that particular order square.
# 2) Have the print_square function auto-calculate how much space
#    to allot between square elements for optimized display.
#    This might require parameterizing the "printf" line.
# 3) Add appropriate functions for generating magic squares
#    with an *even* number of rows/columns.
#    This is non-trivial(!).

#  Most of the following points are described at length in
#+ the text of the foregoing "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide."
#  This demonstration script is mostly just a reorganized presentation.
#      -- msz

# Variables are not typed unless otherwise specified.

#  Variables are named. Names must contain a non-digit.
#  File descriptor names (as in, for example: 2&gt;&amp;1)
#+ contain ONLY digits.

# Parameters and Bash array elements are numbered.
# (Parameters are very similar to Bash arrays.)

# A variable name may be undefined (null reference).
unset VarNull

# A variable name may be defined but empty (null contents).
VarEmpty=''                         # Two, adjacent, single quotes.

# A variable name may be defined and non-empty.
VarSomething='Literal'

# A variable may contain:
#   * A whole number as a signed 32-bit (or larger) integer
#   * A string
# A variable may also be an array.

#  A string may contain embedded blanks and may be treated
#+ as if it where a function name with optional arguments.

#  The names of variables and the names of functions
#+ are in different namespaces.


#  A variable may be defined as a Bash array either explicitly or
#+ implicitly by the syntax of the assignment statement.
#  Explicit:
declare -a ArrayVar



# The echo command is a builtin.
echo $VarSomething

# The printf command is a builtin.
# Translate %s as: String-Format
printf %s $VarSomething         # No linebreak specified, none output.
echo                            # Default, only linebreak output.




# The Bash parser word breaks on whitespace.
# Whitespace, or the lack of it is significant.
# (This holds true in general; there are, of course, exceptions.)




# Translate the DOLLAR_SIGN character as: Content-Of.

# Extended-Syntax way of writing Content-Of:
echo ${VarSomething}

#  The ${ ... } Extended-Syntax allows more than just the variable
#+ name to be specified.
#  In general, $VarSomething can always be written as: ${VarSomething}.

# Call this script with arguments to see the following in action.



#  Outside of double-quotes, the special characters @ and *
#+ specify identical behavior.
#  May be pronounced as: All-Elements-Of.

#  Without specification of a name, they refer to the
#+ pre-defined parameter Bash-Array.



# Glob-Pattern references
echo $*                         # All parameters to script or function
echo ${*}                       # Same

# Bash disables filename expansion for Glob-Patterns.
# Only character matching is active.


# All-Elements-Of references
echo $@                         # Same as above
echo ${@}                       # Same as above




#  Within double-quotes, the behavior of Glob-Pattern references
#+ depends on the setting of IFS (Input Field Separator).
#  Within double-quotes, All-Elements-Of references behave the same.


#  Specifying only the name of a variable holding a string refers
#+ to all elements (characters) of a string.


#  To specify an element (character) of a string,
#+ the Extended-Syntax reference notation (see below) MAY be used.




#  Specifying only the name of a Bash array references
#+ the subscript zero element,
#+ NOT the FIRST DEFINED nor the FIRST WITH CONTENTS element.

#  Additional qualification is needed to reference other elements,
#+ which means that the reference MUST be written in Extended-Syntax.
#  The general form is: ${name[subscript]}.

#  The string forms may also be used: ${name:subscript}
#+ for Bash-Arrays when referencing the subscript zero element.


# Bash-Arrays are implemented internally as linked lists,
#+ not as a fixed area of storage as in some programming languages.


#   Characteristics of Bash arrays (Bash-Arrays):
#   --------------------------------------------

#   If not otherwise specified, Bash-Array subscripts begin with
#+  subscript number zero. Literally: [0]
#   This is called zero-based indexing.
###
#   If not otherwise specified, Bash-Arrays are subscript packed
#+  (sequential subscripts without subscript gaps).
###
#   Negative subscripts are not allowed.
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array need not all be of the same type.
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may be undefined (null reference).
#       That is, a Bash-Array may be "subscript sparse."
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may be defined and empty (null contents).
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may contain:
#     * A whole number as a signed 32-bit (or larger) integer
#     * A string
#     * A string formated so that it appears to be a function name
#     + with optional arguments
###
#   Defined elements of a Bash-Array may be undefined (unset).
#       That is, a subscript packed Bash-Array may be changed
#   +   into a subscript sparse Bash-Array.
###
#   Elements may be added to a Bash-Array by defining an element
#+  not previously defined.
###
# For these reasons, I have been calling them "Bash-Arrays".
# I'll return to the generic term "array" from now on.

# Put IFS back to the default.
# Default is exactly these three bytes.
IFS=$'\x20'$'\x09'$'\x0A'           # In exactly this order.

# Interpretation of the above outputs:
#   A Glob-Pattern is I/O; the setting of IFS matters.
###
#   An All-Elements-Of does not consider IFS settings.
###
#   Note the different output using the echo command and the
#+  quoted format operator of the printf command.


#  Recall:
#   Parameters are similar to arrays and have the similar behaviors.
###
#  The above examples demonstrate the possible variations.
#  To retain the shape of a sparse array, additional script
#+ programming is required.
###
#  The source code of Bash has a routine to output the
#+ [subscript]=value   array assignment format.
#  As of version 2.05b, that routine is not used,
#+ but that might change in future releases.

# echo ${#test}                     # See that?



#  The length of an array, measured in defined elements,
#+ including null content elements.
echo
echo 'Defined content count: '${#ArrayVar[@]}' elements.'
# That is NOT the maximum subscript (4).
# That is NOT the range of the subscripts (1 . . 4 inclusive).
# It IS the length of the linked list.
###
#  Both the maximum subscript and the range of the subscripts may
#+ be found with additional script programming.

# The length of a string, measured in non-null elements (characters):
echo
echo '- - Quoted, Glob-Pattern references - -'
echo 'Non-Null character count: '"${#VarSomething}"' characters.'

#  The length of an array, measured in defined elements,

echo
echo 'Defined element count: '"${#ArrayVar[*]}"' elements.'

#  Interpretation: Substitution does not effect the ${# ... } operation.
#  Suggestion:
#  Always use the All-Elements-Of character
#+ if that is what is intended (independence from IFS).



#  Define a simple function.
#  I include an underscore in the name

#  A string operation applies to all elements (characters) of the string
#+ (in concept, anyway).
###
#  The notation: ${array_name[@]} represents all elements of the
#+ Bash-Array: array_name.
###
#  The Extended-Syntax string operations can be applied to all
#+ elements of an array.
###
#  This may be thought of as a For-Each operation on a vector of strings.
###
#  Parameters are similar to an array.
#  The initialization of a parameter array for a script
#+ and a parameter array for a function only differ
#+ in the initialization of ${0}, which never changes its setting.
###
#  Subscript zero of the script's parameter array contains
#+ the name of the script.
###
#  Subscript zero of a function's parameter array DOES NOT contain
#+ the name of the function.
#  The name of the current function is accessed by the $FUNCNAME variable.
###
#  A quick, review list follows (quick, not short).

# "Subscript sparse" Bash-Arrays
###
#  Bash-Arrays are subscript packed, beginning with
#+ subscript zero unless otherwise specified.
###
#  The initialization of ArrayVar was one way
#+ to "otherwise specify".  Here is the other way:
###
echo
declare -a ArraySparse
ArraySparse=( [1]=one [2]='' [4]='four' )
# [0]=null reference, [2]=null content, [3]=null reference

echo '- - Array-Sparse List - -'
# Within double-quotes, default IFS, Glob-Pattern

IFS=$'\x20'$'\x09'$'\x0A'
printf %q "${ArraySparse[*]}"
echo

#  Note that the output does not distinguish between "null content"
#+ and "null reference".
#  Both print as escaped whitespace.
###
#  Note also that the output does NOT contain escaped whitespace
#+ for the "null reference(s)" prior to the first defined element.
###
# This behavior of 2.04, 2.05a and 2.05b has been reported
#+ and may change in a future version of Bash.

#  To output a sparse array and maintain the [subscript]=value
#+ relationship without change requires a bit of programming.
#  One possible code fragment:
###
# local l=${#ArraySparse[@]}        # Count of defined elements
# local f=0                         # Count of found subscripts
# local i=0                         # Subscript to test
(                                   # Anonymous in-line function
    for (( l=${#ArraySparse[@]}, f = 0, i = 0 ; f &lt; l ; i++ ))
    do
        # 'if defined then...'
        ${ArraySparse[$i]+ eval echo '\ ['$i']='${ArraySparse[$i]} ; (( f++ )) }
    done
)

# The reader coming upon the above code fragment cold
#+ might want to review "command lists" and "multiple commands on a line"
#+ in the text of the foregoing "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide."
###
#  Note:
#  The "read -a array_name" version of the "read" command
#+ begins filling array_name at subscript zero.
#  ArraySparse does not define a value at subscript zero.
###
#  The user needing to read/write a sparse array to either
#+ external storage or a communications socket must invent
#+ a read/write code pair suitable for their purpose.
###
# Exercise: clean it up.

      <title>A Sed and Awk Micro-Primer</title>
      
      <para><anchor xml:id="sedref" /></para>

      <para>This is a very brief introduction to the <command>sed</command>
	and <command>awk</command> text processing utilities. We will
	deal with only a few basic commands here, but that will suffice
	for understanding simple sed and awk constructs within shell
	scripts.</para>


       <para><command>sed</command>: a non-interactive
         text file editor</para>

       <para><command>awk</command>: a field-oriented pattern processing
         language with a <command>C</command>-style syntax</para>

       <para>For all their differences, the two utilities share a similar
	 invocation syntax, use <link linkend="regexref">regular
	 expressions </link>, read input by default
	 from <filename>stdin</filename>, and output to
	 <filename>stdout</filename>. These are well-behaved UNIX tools,
	 and they work together well. The output from one can be piped
	 to the other, and their combined capabilities give shell scripts
	 some of the power of <link linkend="perlref">Perl</link>.</para>

       <note><para>One important difference between the utilities is
	 that while shell scripts can easily pass arguments to sed, it
	 is more cumbersome for awk (see <xref linkend="coltotaler" />
	 and <xref linkend="coltotaler2" />).
	 </para></note>


    <section>
      <title>Sed</title>

      <para><firstterm>Sed</firstterm> is a non-interactive
          <footnote><para><firstterm>Sed</firstterm> executes without
          user intervention.</para></footnote>
	<command>s</command>tream <command>ed</command>itor. It
	receives text input, whether from <filename>stdin</filename>
	or from a file, performs certain operations on specified lines
	of the input, one line at a time, then outputs the result to
	<filename>stdout</filename> or to a file.  Within a shell script,
	<firstterm>sed</firstterm> is usually one of several tool
	components in a pipe.</para>

      <para><firstterm>Sed</firstterm> determines which lines of
        its input that it will operate on from the <firstterm>address
        range</firstterm> passed to it.
	  <footnote><para>If no address range is specified, the default
	  is <emphasis>all</emphasis> lines.</para></footnote>
	Specify this address range either by line number or by a
	pattern to match. For example, <replaceable>3d</replaceable>
	signals <firstterm>sed</firstterm> to delete line 3 of the
	input, and <replaceable>/Windows/d</replaceable> tells sed
	that you want every line of the input containing a match to
	<quote>Windows</quote> deleted.</para>

      <para>Of all the operations in the <firstterm>sed</firstterm>
	toolkit, we will focus primarily on the three most commonly
	used ones. These are <command>p</command>rinting (to
	<filename>stdout</filename>), <command>d</command>eletion,
	and <command>s</command>ubstitution.</para>

     <para>Substituting a zero-length string for another is equivalent
       to deleting that string within a line of input. This leaves the
       remainder of the line intact. Applying <userinput>s/GUI//</userinput>   
       to the line
       <screen><userinput>The most important parts of any application are its GUI and sound effects</userinput></screen>
       results in
       <screen><computeroutput>The most important parts of any application are its  and sound effects</computeroutput></screen></para>

     <para>A backslash forces the <command>sed</command> replacement
       command to continue on to the next line. This has the effect of
       using the <firstterm>newline</firstterm> at the end of the first
       line as the <firstterm>replacement string</firstterm>.

       <programlisting>s/^  */\
/g</programlisting>

       This substitution replaces line-beginning spaces with a
       newline. The net result is to replace paragraph indents with a
       blank line between paragraphs.</para>

     <para>An address range followed by one or more operations may require
       open and closed curly brackets, with appropriate newlines. 
       <programlisting>/[0-9A-Za-z]/,/^$/{
/^$/d
}</programlisting>
       This deletes only the first of each set of consecutive blank
       lines. That might be useful for single-spacing a text file,
       but retaining the blank line(s) between paragraphs.</para>


     <note><para>The usual delimiter that <firstterm>sed</firstterm> uses is
      <token>/</token>. However, <emphasis>sed</emphasis> allows other
      delimiters, such as <token>%</token>. This is useful when
      <token>/</token> is part of a replacement string, as in a file pathname.

       is a full-featured text processing language with a syntax
       reminiscent of <firstterm>C</firstterm>.  While it possesses an
       extensive set of operators and capabilities, we will cover only
       a few of these here - the ones most useful in shell scripts.</para>

     <para>Awk breaks each line of input passed to it into
       <anchor xml:id="fieldref2" />

       is a string of consecutive characters delimited by <link linkend="whitespaceref">whitespace</link>, though there are options
       for changing this. Awk parses and operates on each separate
       field. This makes it ideal for handling structured text files

       such as rows and columns.</para>

       here is variables. Awk handles variables similarly to shell
       scripts, though a bit more flexibly.</para>

     <para><programlisting>{ total += ${column_number} }</programlisting>
       This adds the value of <parameter>column_number</parameter> to
       the running total of <parameter>total</parameter>&gt;. Finally, to print
       <quote>total</quote>, there is an <command>END</command> command
       block, executed after the script has processed all its input.
       <programlisting>END { print total }</programlisting></para>

     <para>Corresponding to the <command>END</command>, there is a
       <command>BEGIN</command>, for a code block to be performed before awk
       starts processing its input.</para>

      <para><programlisting>Doing it correctly: A quick summary
by David Wheeler
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html

So, how can you process filenames correctly in shell? Here's a quick
summary about how to do it correctly, for the impatient who "just want the
answer". In short: Double-quote to use "$variable" instead of $variable,
set IFS to just newline and tab, prefix all globs/filenames so they cannot
begin with "-" when expanded, and use one of a few templates that work
correctly. Here are some of those templates that work correctly:


 IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"
 # Remove SPACE, so filenames with spaces work well.

 #  Correct glob use:
 #+ always use "for" loop, prefix glob, check for existence:
 for file in ./* ; do          # Use "./*" ... NEVER bare "*" ...
   if [ -e "$file" ] ; then    # Make sure it isn't an empty match.
     COMMAND ... "$file" ...
   fi
 done



 # Correct glob use, but requires nonstandard bash extension.
 shopt -s nullglob  #  Bash extension,
                    #+ so that empty glob matches will work.
 for file in ./* ; do        # Use "./*", NEVER bare "*"
   COMMAND ... "$file" ...
 done



 #  These handle all filenames correctly;
 #+ can be unwieldy if COMMAND is large:
 find ... -exec COMMAND... {} \;
 find ... -exec COMMAND... {} \+ # If multiple files are okay for COMMAND.



 #  This skips filenames with control characters
 #+ (including tab and newline).
 IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"
 controlchars="$(printf '*[\001-\037\177]*')"
 for file in $(find . ! -name "$controlchars"') ; do
   COMMAND "$file" ...
 done



 #  Okay if filenames can't contain tabs or newlines --
 #+ beware the assumption.
 IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"
 for file in $(find .) ; do
   COMMAND "$file" ...
 done



 # Requires nonstandard but common extensions in find and xargs:
 find . -print0 | xargs -0 COMMAND

 # Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell (bash works).
 # variables might not stay set once the loop ends:
 find . -print0 | while IFS="" read -r -d "" file ; do ...
   COMMAND "$file" # Use quoted "$file", not $file, everywhere.
 done



 #  Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell (bash works).
 #  Underlying system must include named pipes (FIFOs)
 #+ or the /dev/fd mechanism.
 #  In this version, variables *do* stay set after the loop ends,
 #  and you can read from stdin.
 #+ (Change the 4 to another number if fd 4 is needed.)

 while IFS="" read -r -d "" file &lt;&amp;4 ; do
   COMMAND "$file"   # Use quoted "$file" -- not $file, everywhere.
 done 4&lt; &lt;(find . -print0)


 #  Named pipe version.
 #  Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell's read (bash ok).
 #  Underlying system must include named pipes (FIFOs).
 #  Again, in this version, variables *do* stay set after the loop ends,
 #  and you can read from stdin.
 # (Change the 4 to something else if fd 4 needed).

 mkfifo mypipe

 find . -print0 &gt; mypipe &amp;
 while IFS="" read -r -d "" file &lt;&amp;4 ; do
   COMMAND "$file" # Use quoted "$file", not $file, everywhere.
 done 4&lt; mypipe</programlisting></para>

      <para><anchor xml:id="sysexitsref" /></para>
      <para>There has been an attempt to systematize exit status numbers

	the range <returnvalue>64 - 113</returnvalue> (in addition to
	<returnvalue>0</returnvalue>, for success), to conform with
	the C/C++ standard. This would allot 50 valid codes, and make

	  <footnote><para>An update of <filename class="headerfile">/usr/include/sysexits.h</filename>
	  allocates previously unused exit codes from <returnvalue>64

	  unallotted exit codes will be further restricted in the future.
	  The author of this document will <emphasis>not</emphasis> do
	  fixups on the scripting examples to conform to the changing
	  standard. This should not cause any problems, since there

      <para><anchor xml:id="stdinoutdef" /></para>
      <para>A command expects the first three <link linkend="fdref">file
        descriptors</link> to be available. The first, <firstterm>fd
        0</firstterm> (standard input, <filename>stdin</filename>),
        is for reading. The other two (<firstterm>fd 1</firstterm>,
        <filename>stdout</filename> and <firstterm>fd 2</firstterm>,
        <filename>stderr</filename>) are for writing.</para>

      <para>There is a <filename>stdin</filename>, <filename>stdout</filename>,
        and a <filename>stderr</filename> associated with each command.
        <userinput>ls 2&gt;&amp;1</userinput> means temporarily connecting the
        <filename>stderr</filename> of the <command>ls</command> command to the
        same <quote>resource</quote> as the shell's
        <filename>stdout</filename>.</para>

      <para>By convention, a command reads its input from fd 0
        (<filename>stdin</filename>), prints normal output to fd
        1 (<filename>stdout</filename>), and error ouput to fd 2
        (<filename>stderr</filename>). If one of those three fd's is
        not open, you may encounter problems:</para>

      <screen>
<prompt>bash$ </prompt><userinput>cat /etc/passwd &gt;&amp;-</userinput>
<computeroutput>cat: standard output: Bad file descriptor</computeroutput>
      </screen>

      <para>For example, when <command>xterm</command> runs, it first
        initializes itself.  Before running the user's shell,
        <command>xterm</command> opens the terminal device
        (/dev/pts/&lt;n&gt; or something similar) three times.</para>

      <para>At this point, Bash inherits these three file descriptors,
        and each command (child process) run by Bash inherits
        them in turn, except when you redirect the command.  <link linkend="ioredirref">Redirection</link> means reassigning
        one of the file descriptors to another file (or a pipe, or
        anything permissible). File descriptors may be reassigned
        locally (for a command, a command group, a <link linkend="subshellsref">subshell</link>, a <link linkend="redirref">while or if or case or for loop</link>...),
        or globally, for the remainder of the shell (using <link linkend="execref">exec</link>).</para>

      <para><userinput>ls &gt; /dev/null</userinput> means

     <title>Command-Line Options</title>

     <para>Many executables, whether binaries or script files, accept
       options to modify their run-time behavior. For example: from
       the command-line, typing <command>command -o</command>
       would invoke <emphasis>command</emphasis>, with option
       <option>o</option>.</para>

     <title>Standard Command-Line Options</title>

      <para>Over time, there has evolved a loose standard for the
        meanings of command-line option flags. The GNU utilities conform
        more closely to this <quote>standard</quote> than older UNIX
        utilities.</para>

      <para>Traditionally, UNIX command-line options consist of a dash,

  <appendix xml:id="localization">
      <title>Localization</title>


      <para>Localization is an undocumented Bash feature.</para>

      <para><anchor xml:id="localeref" />A localized shell script echoes
        its text output in the language defined as the system's locale.
        A Linux user in Berlin, Germany, would get script output in German,
        whereas his cousin in Berlin, Maryland, would get output from
        the same script in English.</para>

      <para>To create a localized script, use the following template to
        write all messages to the user (error messages, prompts,
        etc.).</para>

      <para>
      <programlisting>#!/bin/bash
# localized.sh
#  Script by Stéphane Chazelas,
#+ modified by Bruno Haible, bugfixed by Alfredo Pironti.

. gettext.sh

E_CDERROR=65

error()
{
  printf "$@" &gt;&amp;2
  exit $E_CDERROR
}

cd $var || error "`eval_gettext \"Can\'t cd to \\\$var.\"`"
#  The triple backslashes (escapes) in front of $var needed
#+ "because eval_gettext expects a string
#+ where the variable values have not yet been substituted."
#    -- per Bruno Haible
read -p "`gettext \"Enter the value: \"`" var
#  ...


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Alfredo Pironti comments:

#  This script has been modified to not use the $"..." syntax in
#+ favor of the "`gettext \"...\"`" syntax.
#  This is ok, but with the new localized.sh program, the commands
#+ "bash -D filename" and "bash --dump-po-string filename"
#+ will produce no output
#+ (because those command are only searching for the $"..." strings)!
#  The ONLY way to extract strings from the new file is to use the
# 'xgettext' program. However, the xgettext program is buggy.

# Note that 'xgettext' has another bug.
#
# The shell fragment:
#    gettext -s "I like Bash"
# will be correctly extracted, but . . .
#    xgettext -s "I like Bash"
# . . . fails!
#  'xgettext' will extract "-s" because
#+ the command only extracts the
#+ very first argument after the 'gettext' word.


#  Escape characters:
#
#  To localize a sentence like
#     echo -e "Hello\tworld!"
#+ you must use
#     echo -e "`gettext \"Hello\\tworld\"`"
#  The "double escape character" before the `t' is needed because
#+ 'gettext' will search for a string like: 'Hello\tworld'
#  This is because gettext will read one literal `\')
#+ and will output a string like "Bonjour\tmonde",
#+ so the 'echo' command will display the message correctly.
#
#  You may not use
#     echo "`gettext -e \"Hello\tworld\"`"
#+ due to the xgettext bug explained above.



# Let's localize the following shell fragment:
#     echo "-h display help and exit"
#
# First, one could do this:
#     echo "`gettext \"-h display help and exit\"`"
#  This way 'xgettext' will work ok,
#+ but the 'gettext' program will read "-h" as an option!
#
# One solution could be
#     echo "`gettext -- \"-h display help and exit\"`"
#  This way 'gettext' will work,
#+ but 'xgettext' will extract "--", as referred to above.
#
# The workaround you may use to get this string localized is
#     echo -e "`gettext \"\\0-h display help and exit\"`"
#  We have added a \0 (NULL) at the beginning of the sentence.
#  This way 'gettext' works correctly, as does 'xgettext.'
#  Moreover, the NULL character won't change the behavior
#+ of the 'echo' command.

      <para>
      <screen><prompt>bash$ </prompt><userinput>bash -D localized.sh</userinput>
<computeroutput>"Can't cd to %s."
 "Enter the value: "</computeroutput></screen>

      This lists all the localized text. (The <option>-D</option>
      option lists double-quoted strings prefixed by a <token>$</token>,
      without executing the script.)</para>

      <para>
      <screen><prompt>bash$ </prompt><userinput>bash --dump-po-strings localized.sh</userinput>
<computeroutput>#: a:6
 msgid "Can't cd to %s."

 #: a:7
 msgid "Enter the value: "
 msgstr ""</computeroutput></screen>
      
      The <option>--dump-po-strings</option> option to Bash
      resembles the <option>-D</option> option, but uses <link linkend="gettextref">gettext</link> <quote>po</quote> format.

      </para>

      <note>
      <para>Bruno Haible points out:</para>

      <para>Starting with gettext-0.12.2, <command>xgettext -o - localized.sh</command>
      is recommended instead of <command>bash --dump-po-strings
      localized.sh</command>, because <command>xgettext</command> . . .</para>
      
      <para>1. understands the gettext and eval_gettext commands
      (whereas bash --dump-po-strings understands only its deprecated
      $"..." syntax)</para>

      <para>2. can extract comments placed by the programmer, intended
      to be read by the translator.</para>

      <para>This shell code is then not specific to Bash any
      more; it works the same way with Bash 1.x and other /bin/sh
      implementations.</para>
      </note>


      <para>Now, build a <filename>language.po</filename>
	file for each language that the script will be translated
	into, specifying the <replaceable>msgstr</replaceable>. Alfredo
	Pironti gives the following example:</para>

      <para>fr.po:

      <programlisting>#: a:6
msgid "Can't cd to $var."
msgstr "Impossible de se positionner dans le repertoire $var."
#: a:7
msgid "Enter the value: "
msgstr "Entrez la valeur : "

#  The string are dumped with the variable names, not with the %s syntax,
#+ similar to C programs.
#+ This is a very cool feature if the programmer uses
#+ variable names that make sense!</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>Then, run <link linkend="msgfmtref">msgfmt</link>.</para>
      <para><userinput>msgfmt -o localized.sh.mo fr.po</userinput></para>

      <para>Place the resulting <filename>localized.sh.mo</filename> file in the
        <filename class="directory">/usr/local/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES</filename>
        directory, and at the beginning of the script, insert the lines:

	  <programlisting>TEXTDOMAINDIR=/usr/local/share/locale
TEXTDOMAIN=localized.sh</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>If a user on a French system runs the script, she will get
        French messages.</para>

      <note>
      <para>With older versions of Bash or other shells, localization requires
        <link linkend="gettextref">gettext</link>, using the
	<option>-s</option> option. In this case, the script becomes:</para>

      <para><anchor xml:id="gettextexample" />
      <programlisting>#!/bin/bash
# localized.sh

E_CDERROR=65

error() {
  local format=$1
  shift
  printf "$(gettext -s "$format")" "$@" &gt;&amp;2
  exit $E_CDERROR
}
cd $var || error "Can't cd to %s." "$var"
read -p "$(gettext -s "Enter the value: ")" var
# ...</programlisting>
      </para>
      </note>

      <para>The <varname>TEXTDOMAIN</varname> and
	<varname>TEXTDOMAINDIR</varname> variables need to be set and
	exported to the environment. This should be done within the
	script itself.</para>

#  This file is normally read by interactive shells only.
#+ Here is the place to define your aliases, functions and
#+ other interactive features like your prompt.
#
#  The majority of the code here assumes you are on a GNU
#+ system (most likely a Linux box) and is often based on code
#+ found on Usenet or Internet.
#
#  See for instance:
#  http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html
#  http://www.caliban.org/bash
#  http://www.shelldorado.com/scripts/categories.html
#  http://www.dotfiles.org
#
#  The choice of colors was done for a shell with a dark background
#+ (white on black), and this is usually also suited for pure text-mode
#+ consoles (no X server available). If you use a white background,
#+ you'll have to do some other choices for readability.
#
#  This bashrc file is a bit overcrowded.
#  Remember, it is just an example.

#  Otherwise, the value of PCT variable is assigned only once,

#  Otherwise the value of the EUID variable will be assigned only once,

#  When a variable is assigned, it should be called escaped:
#+       echo \$T,
#  Otherwise the value of the T variable is taken from the moment the PCT 
#+ variable is exported/read from .bash_profile.
#  So, in this example it would be null.

#  When a variable's value contains a semicolon it should be strong quoted:
#        T='$LIGHTRED',
#  Otherwise, the semicolon will be interpreted as a command separator.


#  Variables PCT and PS1 can be merged into a new PS1 variable:

      <title>Converting DOS Batch Files to Shell Scripts</title>

  <para><anchor xml:id="dosbatch1" /></para>
  <para>Quite a number of programmers learned scripting on a PC running
    DOS. Even the crippled DOS batch file language allowed writing some
    fairly powerful scripts and applications, though they often required
    extensive kludges and workarounds. Occasionally, the need still
    arises to convert an old DOS batch file to a UNIX shell script. This
    is generally not difficult, as DOS batch file operators are only a
    limited subset of the equivalent shell scripting ones.</para>

      <note>
      <para>Virtually all UNIX and shell operators and commands have
	many more options and enhancements than their DOS and batch file
	counterparts. Many DOS batch files rely on auxiliary utilities,
	such as <command>ask.com</command>, a crippled counterpart to
	<link linkend="readref">read</link>.</para>

      <para>DOS supports only a very limited and incompatible subset of
	filename <link linkend="globbingref">wild-card expansion</link>,
	recognizing just the <token>*</token> and <token>?</token>
	characters.</para>
	</note>

      <para>Converting a DOS batch file into a shell script is generally
	straightforward, and the result ofttimes reads better than the
	original.</para>

      Inside, among various dusty uninteresting exhibits is a corroding,
      cobweb-festooned brass plaque inscribed with a short, very short
      list of those few persons who have successfully mastered the material
      in the <firstterm>Advanced Bash Scripting Guide</firstterm>, as evidenced by their performance
      on the following Exercise sections.

      (Alas, the author of the <firstterm>ABS Guide</firstterm> is not represented among the exhibits.

	    <para>Implement the Playfair (Wheatstone) Cipher in a

	    <para>The Playfair Cipher encrypts text by substitution
	      of <firstterm>digrams</firstterm> (2-letter groupings).
	      It is traditional to use a 5 x 5 letter scrambled-alphabet

   V W X Y Z

Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except "I" also represents
"J". The arbitrarily chosen key word, "CODES" comes first, then all
the rest of the alphabet, in order from left to right, skipping letters
already used.

To encrypt, separate the plaintext message into digrams (2-letter
groups). If a group has two identical letters, delete the second, and
form a new group. If there is a single letter left over at the end,
insert a "null" character, typically an "X."

THIS IS A TOP SECRET MESSAGE

TH IS IS AT OP SE CR ET ME SA GE



For each digram, there are three possibilities.
-----------------------------------------------

1) Both letters will be on the same row of the key square:
   For each letter, substitute the one immediately to the right, in that
   row. If necessary, wrap around left to the beginning of the row.

or

2) Both letters will be in the same column of the key square:
   For each letter, substitute the one immediately below it, in that
   row. If necessary, wrap around to the top of the column.

or

3) Both letters will form the corners of a rectangle within the key square:
   For each letter, substitute the one on the other corner the rectangle
   which lies on the same row.


The "TH" digram falls under case #3.
G H
M N
T U           (Rectangle with "T" and "H" at corners)

T --&gt; U
H --&gt; G


The "SE" digram falls under case #1.
C O D E S     (Row containing "S" and "E")

S --&gt; C  (wraps around left to beginning of row)
E --&gt; S

=========================================================================

To decrypt encrypted text, reverse the above procedure under cases #1
and #2 (move in opposite direction for substitution). Under case #3,
just take the remaining two corners of the rectangle.

      This document first appeared as a 60-page HOWTO in the late spring
      of 2000. Since then, it has gone through quite a number of updates
      and revisions. This book could not have been written without the
      assistance of the Linux community, and especially of the volunteers
      of the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.tldp.org">Linux Documentation Project</link>.

    <para>Here is the e-mail to the LDP requesting permission to submit

    <para><programlisting>From thegrendel@theriver.com Sat Jun 10 09:05:33 2000 -0700

Subject: Permission to submit HOWTO

Dear HOWTO Coordinator,

I am working on and would like to submit to the LDP a HOWTO on the subject
of "Bash Scripting" (shell scripting, using 'bash'). As it happens,
I have been writing this document, off and on, for about the last eight
months or so, and I could produce a first draft in ASCII text format in
a matter of just a few more days.

I began writing this out of frustration at being unable to find a
decent book on shell scripting. I managed to locate some pretty good
articles on various aspects of scripting, but nothing like a complete,
beginning-to-end tutorial.  Well, in keeping with my philosophy, if all
else fails, do it yourself.

As it stands, this proposed "Bash-Scripting HOWTO" would serve as a
combination tutorial and reference, with the heavier emphasis on the
tutorial. It assumes Linux experience, but only a very basic level
of programming skills. Interspersed with the text are 79 illustrative
example scripts of varying complexity, all liberally commented. There
are even exercises for the reader.

At this stage, I'm up to 18,000+ words (124k), and that's over 50 pages of
text (whew!).


I haven't mentioned that I've previously authored an LDP HOWTO, the
"Software-Building HOWTO", which I wrote in Linuxdoc/SGML. I don't know
if I could handle Docbook/SGML, and I'm glad you have volunteers to do
the conversion. You people seem to have gotten on a more organized basis
these last few months. Working with Greg Hankins and Tim Bynum was nice,
but a professional team is even nicer.

Anyhow, please advise.
